Install them as\nyou would any other package!\n\nIf no build tool is enough to suit your needs, you can create a file named `.atom-build.json`\nin your project root, and specify exactly how your project is built:\n\n    {\n      \"cmd\": \"<command to execute>\",\n      \"name\": \"<name of target>\",\n      \"args\": [ \"<argument1>\", \"<argument2>\", ... ],\n      \"sh\": true,\n      \"cwd\": \"<current working directory for `cmd`>\",\n      \"env\": {\n        \"VARIABLE1\": \"VALUE1\",\n        \"VARIABLE2\": \"VALUE2\",\n        ...\n      },\n      \"errorMatch\": [\n        \"^regexp1$\",\n        \"^regexp2$\"\n      ],\n      \"keymap\": \"<keymap string>\",\n      \"targets\": {\n        \"<name of target>\": {\n          \"cmd\": \"<command to execute>\",\n          ... (all previous options are viable here except `targets`)\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nNote that if `sh` is false `cmd` must only be the executable - no arguments here. If the\nexecutable is not in your path, either fully qualify it or specify the path\nin you environment (e.g. by setting the `PATH` var appropriately on UNIX-like\nsystems).\n\n<a name=\"custom-build-config\"></a>\n### Configuration options\n\nOption       | Required       | Description\n-------------|----------------|-----------------------\n`cmd`        | **[required]** | The executable command\n`name`       | *[optional]*   | The name of the targets. Viewed in the targets list (toggled by `build:select-active-target`).\n`args`       | *[optional]*   | An array of arguments for the command\n`sh`         | *[optional]*   | If `true`, the combined command and arguments will be passed to `/bin/sh`. Default `true`.\n`cwd`        | *[optional]*   | The working directory for the command. E.g. what `.` resolves to.\n`env`        | *[optional]*   | An object of environment variables and their values to set\n`errorMatch` | *[optional]*   | A (list of) regular expressions to match output to a file, row and col. See [Error matching](#error-match) for details.\n`keymap`     | *[optional]*   | A keymap string as defined by [`Atom`](https://atom.io/docs/latest/behind-atom-keymaps-in-depth). Pressing this key combination will trigger the target. Examples: `ctrl-alt-k` or `cmd-U`.\n`targets`    | *[optional]*   | Additional targets which can be used to build variations of your project.\n\n### Replacements\n\nThe following parameters will be replaced in `cmd`, any entry in `args`, `cwd` and\nvalues of `env`. They should all be enclosed in curly brackets `{}`\n\n  * `{FILE_ACTIVE}` - Full path to the currently active file in Atom. E.g. `/home/noseglid/github/atom-build/lib/build.js`\n  * `{FILE_ACTIVE_PATH}` - Full path to the folder where the currently active file is. E.g. `/home/noseglid/github/atom-build/lib`\n  * `{FILE_ACTIVE_NAME}` - Full name and extension of active file. E.g., `build.js`\n  * `{FILE_ACTIVE_NAME_BASE}` - Name of active file WITHOUT extension. E.g., `build`\n  * `{PROJECT_PATH}` - Full path to the root of the project. This is normally the path Atom has as root. E.g `/home/noseglid/github/atom-build`\n  * `{REPO_BRANCH_SHORT}` - Short name of the current active branch (if project is backed by git). E.g `master` or `v0.9.1`.\n\n<a name=\"error-match\"></a>\n## Error matching\n\nError matching let's you specify a single regular expression or a list of\nregular expressions, which capture the output of your build command and open the\ncorrect file, row and column of the error. For instance:\n\n```bash\n../foo/bar/a.c:4:26: error: expected ';' after expression\n  printf(\"hello world\\n\")\n                         ^\n                         ;\n1 error generated.\n```\n\nWould be matched with the regular expression: `\\n(?<file>[\\\\/0-9a-zA-Z\\\\._]+):(?<line>\\\\d+):(?<col>\\\\d+)`.\nAfter the build has failed, pressing `cmd-alt-g` (OS X) or `f4` (Linux/Windows), `a.c` would be\nopened and the cursor would be placed at row 4, column 26.\n\nNote the syntax for match groups. This is from the [XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/) package\nand has the syntax for named groups: `(?<name> RE )` where `name` would be the name of the group\nmatched by the regular expression `RE`.\n\nThe following named groups can be matched from the output:\n  * `file` - **[required]** the file to open. May be relative `cwd` or absolute. `(?<file> RE)`.\n  * `line` - *[optional]* the line the error resides on. `(?<line> RE)`.\n  * `col` - *[optional]* the column the error resides on. `(?<col> RE)`.\n\nSince the regular expressions are written in a JSON file, backslashes must be escaped.\n\nThe `file` should be relative the `cwd` specified. If no `cwd` has been specified, then\nthe `file` should be relative the project root (e.g. the top most directory shown in the\nAtom Editor).\n\nIf your build outputs multiple errors, all will be matched. Press `cmd-alt-g` (OS X) or `ctrl-alt-g` (Linux/Windows)\nto cycle through the errors (in the order they appear, first on stderr then on stdout).\n\nOften, the first error is the most interesting since other errors tend to be secondary faults caused by that first one.\nTo jump to the first error you can use `cmd-alt-h` (OS X) or `shift-f4` (Linux/Windows) at any point to go to the first error.\n\n## Service API (for package developers)\n\nAnother package may provide build information to the `build`-package by implementing its service API.\nThe package should integrate via the service API. This is typically done in `package.json`:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  // <other stuff>\n  \"providedServices\": {\n    \"builder\": {\n      \"description\": \"Description of the build configurations this package gives\",\n      \"versions\": {\n        \"1.0.0\": \"providingFunction\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n},\n```\n\nThe `build`-package will then call `providingFunction` when activated and expects an\nobject in return:\n```javascript\n{\n  niceName: 'string',\n  isEligable: function (path) {},\n  settings: function (path) {},\n  on: function (ev, callback) {}, //optional\n  off: function (ev), //optional\n}\n```\n\nThe `niceName` is esthetic only and should be a `string` which is a human readable\ndescription of the build configuration is provided.\n\n`isEligable` should be a function which must return synchronously. It will get one\nargument, `path`, which is the root folder of the currently active project in Atom.\nIt should return `true` or `false` indicating if it can build that folder into something\nsensible. Typically look for the existence of a build file such as `gulpfile.js` or `Makefile`.\n\n`settings` can return a Promise or an object.. It is called when it is time to build the project.\nIt can provide anything which is allowed by the [custom build configuration](#custom-build-config).\nThis includes the command, `cmd`, to execute, any arguments, `args`, and so on.\n\n_[optional]_ `on` will be called with a string which is the name of an event the build tool provider can emit. The build\ntool provider should call the `callback` when the specified event occurs. Events `build` may ask for include:\n  * `refresh` - call the callback if you want to force `build` to refresh all targets.\n    this is common after the build file has been altered.\n\n_[optional]_ `off` will be called when `build` is no longer interested in that event. It may be because\n`build` is being deactivated, or refreshing its state. `build` will never call `off` for an event unless it has\nprevioused registered a listener via `on` first.\n\nAll functions will be called with the same value for `this` (which is an empty object at first). If you have to make\nany time consuming computation in for instance `isEligable` it may be wise to store the result in `this` and\nreuse it in `settings`.\n\n## Analytics\n\nThe `atom-build` package uses google analytics to keep track of which features are in use\nand at what frequency. This gives the maintainers a sense of what parts of the\npackage is most important and what parts can be removed.\n\nThe data is fully anonymous and can not be tracked back to you in any way.\nThis is what is collected\n\n  * Version of package used.\n  * Build triggered, succeeded or failed.\n  * Which build tool was used.\n  * Visibility of UI components.\n\nIf you really do not want to share this information, you can opt out by disabling\nthe [metrics package](https://atom.io/packages/metrics). This will disable all analytics\ncollection, including the one from `atom-build`.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build#readme","_id":"build@0.49.2","_shasum":"464f07f7df1988b243b35ecaef60dd956cf886fb","_resolved":"file:../d-115111-11920-74u7ka/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115111-11920-74u7ka/package.tgz"}
