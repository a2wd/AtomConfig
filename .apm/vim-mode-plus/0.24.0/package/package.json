You can't use both simultaneously.\n- Following packages for vim-mode doesn't work in vim-mode-plus. Why? Because service API name is different. It's easy to add support I believe. Please report to each project.\n  - [vim-mode-clipboard-plus](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode-clipboard-plus)\n  - [ex-mode](https://atom.io/packages/ex-mode)\n  - [vim-surround](https://atom.io/packages/vim-surround): surround feature included vim-mode-plus, so you won't need this.\n  - [vim-mode-visual-block](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode-visual-block): (my package) builtin to vim-mode-plus with better integration.\n- Scope for CSS selector and keymap is different from vim-mode, **not compatible**.\n- Internal code base is very different. Thus, issue, PRs should be directly sent to vim-mode-plus. **DONT** report vim-mode-plus's issue or PRs to official vim-mode.\n\n# FAQ\n\n### Why fork? why not directly contribute to official vim-mode?\n\n- Changes are too big.\n- Some features are too experimental to merge official vim-mode.\n\n### ex-mode?\n\n- Currently not. Refer [#52](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/issues/52).\n\n### Want to suppress autocomplete-plus's auto suggestion except insert-mode.\n\nSet `suppressActivationForEditorClasses` autocomplete-plus's config to following value.\n\n```\nvim-mode-plus.normal-mode, vim-mode-plus.visual-mode, vim-mode-plus.operator-pending-mode, vim-mode-plus.insert-mode.replace\n```\n\nIf you want to directly edit `config.cson`, here it is.\n\n```coffeescript\n\"autocomplete-plus\":\n  suppressActivationForEditorClasses: [\n    \"vim-mode-plus.normal-mode\"\n    \"vim-mode-plus.visual-mode\"\n    \"vim-mode-plus.operator-pending-mode\"\n    \"vim-mode-plus.insert-mode.replace\"\n  ]\n```\n\n# Wiki\n\n- [Operations](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/wiki/Operations) includes most of commands with keymap information.\n- [GIFs](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/wiki/GIFs) demonstrates fancy features.\n- [Keymap example](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/wiki/Keymap-example).\n- [Extend vmp in init file](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/wiki/Extend-vmp-in-init-file)\n- [Create vmp plugin](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/wiki/Create-vmp-plugin)\n\n## Keymap\n\nSome of the keymap is not set by default, check following link for reference.\n\n- [Operations](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/wiki/Operations)\n- [keymaps](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/blob/master/keymaps/vim-mode-plus.cson)\n- [Keymap example](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/wiki/Keymap-example)\n- [Commands which have no default keymap](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus/wiki/Commands-which-have-no-default-keymap)\n\n# Helper packages\n\nHere is the list of my packages which provide more vim-like experience.  \nWhy I don't builtin these feature?
